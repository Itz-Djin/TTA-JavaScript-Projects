    <!-- GetElementByClassName() Method Assignment -->
    <h2 class="Test">We're going to change this text by use of the GetElementByClassName() Method in JavaScript</h2>
    <h2 class="Test">This text will have the same class as the one above however it won't change because we're going to set a
        variable with the value of the class</h2>
    <p>That variable will pull all elements with that class and create an array out of it in our JS file
        <br> We then can use the [] brackets to specify which element in our array we want to change.
        <br> The first header will be in the array's index position 0 while the second header will be 1.
